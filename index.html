                    <hr>
                    <p>I started coding when I was 19 years old, and I am entirely self-taught. Since then, I have
                        continued to expand my
                        knowledge and hone my skills in the field of software development.</p>
                    <p>My passion for technology and problem-solving dates back to my childhood. I was always fascinated
                        by how machines worked
                        and spent hours tinkering with them to try to understand their inner workings. This fascination
                        fueled my love of
                        technology, and I quickly found myself delving deeper into the world of coding.</p>
                    <p>At my core, I am a problem solver who enjoys taking on challenges and learning new things.</p>
                    <p>I believe that my passion for technology and my desire to constantly learn and grow have been the
                        key factors that have
                        helped me succeed as a self-taught developer.</p>

                    <h5>What I Do</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>As a backend developer, I specialize in creating customized solutions to meet the unique needs of
                        businesses, whether
                        they require automation to streamline their processes or a robust backend to support their
                        application's growth. I have
                        the skills and expertise to deliver high-quality results.</p>
                    <p>I'm proficient in Python and JavaScript, which enables me to develop efficient and robust backend
                        solutions for applications, but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have extensive experience in using PostgreSQL to create high-performance, scalable, and secure
                        databases. And also I'm well-versed in MongoDB, which allows me to create flexible and scalable
                        document-based databases that can be easily
                        integrated into applications.</p>
                    <p>I have a strong understanding of Node.js, which is a powerful and versatile JavaScript runtime
                        that allows me to build
                        high-performance web applications.</p>
                    <p>I'm experienced in building RESTful APIs that enable web applications to communicate with servers
                        and other third-party
                        services also I have a good understanding of GraphQL, which is a query language that provides a
                        more efficient and flexible way of
                        retrieving data from APIs.</p>
                    <p>I have experience in using Repetitive Process Automation (RPA) tools and technologies to automate
                        repetitive and
                        time-consuming tasks, which allows businesses to become more efficient and productive.</p>
                    <p>As a backend developer I have the ability to work closely with businesses to understand their
                        specific needs and requirements.
                        I'm dedicated to delivering solutions that exceed their expectations, and I take pride in my
                        ability to deliver
                        high-quality results on time. With my diverse skill set, I am able to create customized backend
                        solutions that are tailored to businesses' specific
                        needs. Whether you need a web application that can handle large amounts of data, a database that
                        can scale to meet your
                        business's growth, or an RPA automation that can streamline your workflow, I have the skills and
                        expertise to deliver
                        high-quality results.</p>
